/**
 * webtorrent (verified against 3.0.21, pinned exactly in package.json) has two
 * crash bugs that fire from its own timers/handlers and cannot be contained at
 * a call site:
 *
 * 1. Null-piece invariant violation: `pieces[i] === null` should imply
 *    `bitfield.get(i) === true`. _markVerified() (lib/torrent.js) releases a
 *    piece by setting it to null, but several call sites read a piece whenever
 *    the bitfield bit is unset and assume it must therefore be non-null. When
 *    the two fall out of sync the process dies with:
 *
 *      TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'length')
 *      TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'missing')
 *
 *    Each patch treats a null piece as verified, matching _markVerified().
 *
 * 2. Unhandled uTP 'error' events: peer connections attach error handlers with
 *    once() (lib/torrent.js _drain, lib/peer.js onConnect). After the first
 *    error the listener is gone; a second uTP ECONNRESET (emitted from
 *    Connection._onclose) then surfaces as an unhandled 'error' event and
 *    kills the whole process. The patches make the listeners persistent.
 *
 * This script is intentionally non-fatal: if a future webtorrent version
 * changes these files, the patch simply cannot be applied and installs keep
 * working. DownloadEngine verifies the patches at runtime (see
 * src/services/download-engine.ts) and fails with a clear error if they are
 * missing, so a failed patch is never silently ignored.
 *
 * Re-run after every `npm install` (wired up via `postinstall`).
